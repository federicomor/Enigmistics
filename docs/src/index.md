# Enigmistics

Enigmistics.jl is a Julia package for exploring and analyzing language puzzles (e.g. crosswords) and wordgames (e.g. anagrams, pangrams, etc). It provides utilities for constructing such puzzles and for finding wordgames in texts, for example full books. 

More precisely, with Enigmistics.jl, you can:

- Create and display crossword-style grids, eventually with also a user interface through Genie Framework
- Scan texts for searching or verifying word-games
